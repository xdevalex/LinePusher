## 1. Specification
- [x] 1.1 Draft proposal for formalizing the follow welcome message behavior.
- [x] 1.2 Create OpenSpec delta for the `linepusher` capability covering follow welcome behavior.

## 2. Implementation (to be done after proposal approval)
- [ ] 2.1 Verify current implementation of the follow event handler against the new requirement.
- [ ] 2.2 Update implementation if needed so that behavior matches the spec (trigger, welcome content expectations, and invariants).
- [ ] 2.3 Add or update automated tests to cover the follow welcome scenario and invariants.

## 3. Validation
- [ ] 3.1 Run `openspec validate add-follow-welcome-spec --strict --no-interactive` and fix any spec issues.
- [ ] 3.2 Run the test suite and ensure all follow-related tests pass.
- [ ] 3.3 Confirm that behavior is explainable and demonstrable to a non-technical user.
